Official API documentation: https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1beta16

Adding dependency to pubspec.yaml

```
  dependencies:
    google_compute_v1beta16_api: '>=0.4.0'
```

For web applications:

```
  import "package:google_compute_v1beta16_api/compute_v1beta16_api_browser.dart" as computeclient;
```

For console application:

```
  import "package:google_compute_v1beta16_api/compute_v1beta16_api_console.dart" as computeclient;
```

Working with out authentication the following constructor can be called:

```
  var compute = new computeclient.Compute();
```

Working with authentication then create a new `GoogleOAuth2` object and pass it to the constructor:


```
  GoogleOAuth2 auth = new GoogleOAuth2(CLIENT_ID, SCOPES);
  var compute = new computeclient.Compute(auth);
```
